# My portfolio

> This project was the second in my Microverse journey that needed a code review. I had to set the foundations of what would be my personal portfolio. The goal was to be able to parse a Figma design to create a beautiful UI using Flexbox, Grid CSS, images and backgrounds, while sticking to the best practices (Linter, Github Flow, Professional commits and documentation etc.)

> I was supposed to build a UI that is as close as possible to this Figma design: [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A10) 

This project was divided into 10 parts before getting to the full portfolio website. Each part corresponds to a specific branch. The 10 parts are listed below. The one in bold is the one I am currently working on. Refer to the corresponding branch.

1. Setup and mobile version skeleton
2. **List of previous projects + About myself (mobile)**
3. Add a contact form + finish the mobile version
4. Create the desktop version using media queries
5. Deploy on Github Pages
6. Changes regarding accessibility
7. Mobile menu using JavaScript
8. Popup window that includes the project details 
9. Client-side validation in the contact form
10. Use local storage to save form data
