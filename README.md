# My portfolio

> This project was the second in my Microverse journey that needed a code review. I had to set the foundations of what would be my personal portfolio. The goal was to be able to parse a Figma design to create a beautiful UI using flexbox, images and backgrounds, while sticking to the best practices (Linter, Github Flow, Professional commits and documentation etc.)

> This is just the first part out of ten before getting to the full portfolio website. In this part the focus was put on the mobile version skeleton. I was supposed to build a UI that is as close as possible to this Figma design: [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A10)
