# My portfolio

> This project was part of my Microverse journey. I had to work on what would be my personal portfolio. The goal was to be able to parse a Figma design to create a beautiful UI using Flexbox, Grid CSS, images and backgrounds, while sticking to the best practices (Linter, Github Flow, Professional commits and documentation etc.)

> I was supposed to build a UI that is as close as possible to this Figma design: [Figma Template](https://www.figma.com/file/l7SqJ3ZfkAKih9sFxvWSR4/Microverse-Student-Project-1?node-id=23%3A10) 

This project was divided into 10 parts before getting to the full portfolio website. Each part corresponds to a specific branch. The 10 parts are listed below. The text in **bold** refers to the part I am currently working on. Refer to the corresponding branch.

1. Setup and mobile version skeleton
2. List of previous projects + About myself (mobile)
3. Add a contact form + finish the mobile version
4. **Create the desktop version using media queries**
5. Deploy on Github Pages
6. Changes regarding accessibility
7. Mobile menu using JavaScript
8. Popup window that includes the project details 
9. Client-side validation in the contact form
10. Use local storage to save form data
